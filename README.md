# Assignment1_IoT

Hi! This is the repository for the first assignment of the Internet of Things course I'm attending at Sapienza. 
The main idea is to have a program to simulate sensor sending data to ThingsBoard through an MQTT channel. The data is then visualized on a dashboard publicly accessible. You can find more details in the PDF file in this repo: [PDF presentation]() (there is also a pptx if you prefer).   
I've also published a tutorial on Hackster.io: https://www.hackster.io/silvia-del-piano/environmental-station-monitoring-with-thingsboard-dec387 
and a video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyBkWeWnSb4&feature=youtu.be.    
I hope this little project will be useful and fun to you, enjoy!
